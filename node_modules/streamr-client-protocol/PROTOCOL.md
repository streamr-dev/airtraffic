# Protocol

### Requests sent by client

Also see the [Javascript client](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client) documentation.

#### publish

Publishes a new message to a stream. Requires a write permission to the stream.

```
{
  "type": "publish",
  "stream": "streamId",
  "authKey": "authKey",
  "msg": "{}",                 // the message as stringified json
  "ts": 1533924184016,         // timestamp (optional), defaults to current time on server
  "pkey": "deviceId"           // partition key (optional), defaults to none (random partition)
}
```

#### subscribe

Requests that the client be subscribed to a stream-partition from the next published message. Will result in a `subscribed` message, and a stream of `broadcast` messages as they are published.

```
{
  "type": "subscribe",
  "stream": "streamId",
  "partition": 0,         // optional, defaults to 0
  "authKey": "authKey"    // optional, defaults to undefined
}
```

Field     | Description
--------- | --------
type      | Always "subscribe"
stream    | Stream id to subscribe to
partition | Partition number to subscribe to. Optional, defaults to 0
authKey   | User API key or anonymous stream key. Optional. Public streams can be subscribed to without authentication.

#### unsubscribe

Unsubscribes the client from a stream-partition. The response message is `unsubscribed`.

```
{
  "type": "unsubscribe",
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0          // optional, defaults to 0
}
```

Field     | Description
--------- | --------
type      | Always "unsubscribe"
stream    | Stream id to unsubscribe
partition | Partition number to unsubscribe. Optional, defaults to 0

#### resend

Requests a resend for a stream-partition. Responses are either a sequence of a `resending`, one or more `u`, and a `resent`; or a `no_resend` if there is nothing to resend.

```
{
  "type": "resend",
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0          // optional, defaults to 0
  "sub": "subId",
  // one of: "resend_all": true, "resend_last": (number), "resend_from": (offset)
}
```

Field     | Description
--------- | --------
type       | Always "unsubscribe"
stream     | Stream id to unsubscribe
partition  | Partition number to unsubscribe. Optional, defaults to 0
resend_all | Set to true to resend all messages in stream
resend_last| Resend the latest N messages
resend_from| Resend all messages from and including the given offset. Can be used in combination with `resend_to`
resend_to  | Resend up to given offset

### Responses sent by server

Messages sent by the server are arrays with the following structure:

`[messageVersion, messageType, subId || "", messagePayload]`

- `messageVersion` is 0 for all messages.
- `messageType` identifies the message type as follows:

messageType | Description
----------- | -----------
0 | broadcast
1 | unicast
2 | subscribed
3 | unsubscribed
4 | resending
5 | resent
6 | no resend
7 | error

- `subId` is non-empty on `unicast` messages and identifies the subscription by id
- `messagePayload` is the message payload as described below.

#### broadcast (0)

A message addressed to all subscriptions listening on the stream. The message payload is a an event in a stream, wrapped in a header array as follows:

`[version (28), streamId, streamPartition, timestamp, ttl, offset, previousOffset, contentType, streamEvent]`

- `version` is currently 28
- `streamId` what stream this message belongs to
- `streamPartition` what stream partition this message belongs to
- `timestamp` of the message (milliseconds format)
- `ttl` time-to-live of the message in seconds
- `offset` is an increasing number that can be used for message ordering and gap detection
- `previousOffset` is the `offset` of the previous message, used for gap detection
- `contentType` determines how `streamEvent` should be parsed:

contentType | Description
----------- | -----------
27          | `streamEvent` should be parsed as JSON

#### unicast (1)

Unicast messages have non-empty `subId`. Content is just like in the broadcast message.

#### subscribed (2)

Sent in response to a `subscribe` request. Lets the client know that streams were subscribed to.

```
{
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0
}
```

#### unsubscribed (3)

Sent in response to an `unsubscribe` request.

```
{
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0
}
```

#### resending (4)

Sent in response to a `resend` request. Informs the client that a resend is starting.

```
{
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0
}
```

#### resent (5)

Informs the client that a resend for a particular subscription `subId` is complete.

```
{
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0
}
```

#### no resend (6)

Sent in response to a `resend` request. Informs the client that there was nothing to resend.

```
{
  "stream": "id",
  "partition": 0
}
```
